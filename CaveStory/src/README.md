A deck can be generated by doing the following:

1. Run `grab_ja.py <output_dir>` to grab files from <https://cavestory.org>.
2. Apply some regexes to eliminate everything other than text in said files.
	* You'll want to look everything over and ensure it looks decent afterward.
    * `Credits.tsc` uses an alternate syntax, so you'll need to either omit it or handle it separately.
	* For every other file, you can use:
	    * `<[a-zA-Z\-\+]{3}(\d{4}(\:\d{4}){0,3})?` -> `<empty>`
	    * `#\d{4}` -> `<empty>`
	    * `\n\n+` -> `\n`
3. Run `merge_text.py <input_dir> <output_file>` to generate the final body of text for deck conversion on jpdb.
	* Files are merged according to `file_order.txt`. (Huge thank you to _andwhyisit_, owner of <https://cavestory.org>, for providing this!)
