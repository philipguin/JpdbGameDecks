# Decks Status

A complete list of decks in this repository, with store page links, current status, and quality details.


## Columns

* __Game & Store Page__:

    Game title and link to the most appropriate store page (e.g. Steam) when possible. 
    Also notes current progress if incomplete.

* __Difficulty (1-10)__:

    How difficult the Japanese level of the game is (the same as jpdb's rating).
    May include factors outside the scope of the deck, such as grammar patterns.
    Subscript indicates the kind of large language model (LLM) used to derive the number, if any.
    (LLMs can be unreliable, but are suitable in this particular context.)

* __Sortedness (1-10)__:

    How sorted the cards are in terms of gameplay order, roughly speaking.
    Games are generally non-linear, so this value only accounts for that portion of gameplay this is predictable, if any.

* __Quality (1-10)__:

    Quality of the deck, independent of other columns.
    Lower quality decks generally contain more parsing errors, potentially requiring more effort on your part to use.

* __Notes & Sources__:

    Any details the deck creator feels you may want to know before using the deck,
    such as organization of muliple CSVs, or factors contributing to the rated quality or sortedness.
    Also includes attribution to other peoples' work (e.g. translations) if used.

* __Contributor__:

    The name or username of the person who created the deck itself.
    (Credit for any input data, if not taken directly from the source, goes in the previous section.)
