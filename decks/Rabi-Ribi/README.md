The content is divided into three decks: Story, UI and Options.

* "Story" is the main body of text and is chronologically accurate, excepting for the game's inherent non-linearity.
    Does *not* include tutorial and UI elements, however.
    _Can be studied chronologically or by frequency._

* "UI" includes tutorial text, item text, achievements, etc., in order of category only.
	_Recommended to study by frequency,_ but you can plow through the beginning chronologically if you like.
	Begins with information most important to in-game play (tutorials, choices, quest text, etc.) followed by status/item/badge titles, followed by status/item/badge descriptions. 

	TODO: sort out the important bits chronologically, and merge them with "story" in a new combined deck.
	OR we can at least split out tutorials and help text into a chronological deck?

* "Options" includes options menu and difficulty text information.
	_Study to specifically understand the options screen._
