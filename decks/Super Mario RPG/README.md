# Super Mario RPG

Sourced from [LLGTV](http://www.lltvg.com/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG/Transcript) (credits to <i>Mew seeker</i> for this amazing annotated transcript!)

The combined top-level decks are recommended, but if you'd like to rearrange things,
the `split` folder contains a deck for each portion of the original transcript as created by Mew seeker.

* The "In-Game Combined" deck is a merge of story, places, weapons, armor and special attacks, _with rough respect to chronological order!_
In other words, places don't appear until (roughly) before they're shown on the map,
and weapons shouldn't appear until the character is first acquired, etc.

* "Items and Accessories" is a merge of special items, items, and accessories, in that order. The originals are _alphabetically sorted_, so I recommend studying this in order of frequency (or just referencing the above transcript instead).

* "Enemies and Descriptions" is a merge of enemy names and descriptions, in that order. The originals here are also _alphabetically sorted_, and given the longer nature of this, I _strongly_ recommend studying this in frequency order, if at all. (There's a lot of made-up katakana terms here.)
