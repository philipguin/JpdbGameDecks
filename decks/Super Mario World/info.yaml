  Our deck is sorted meticulously, with input text duplicated to accurately reflect the word count.
  Our route takes secret paths when they first become available,
  except for Vanilla Dome's second route which we complete just after Lemmy,
  and Star Road which we complete just before Bowser's Keep.
