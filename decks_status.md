# Deck Status

A full list of every deck in this repository with status and quality details.


## Columns

'Game' names link to the most appropriate store page (e.g. Steam) when possible.

'Progress' refers to how complete the deck is currently. (`-` for 100% complete.)

'Sortedness' (1-10) refers to how roughly sorted the cards are in terms of gameplay.
Games are generally non-linear, so this value only accounts for that portion of gameplay this is predictable, if any.

'Quality' (1-10) refers to how the creator feels about the deck's overall quality, independent of other columns.
Lower quality decks will generally contain more parsing errors, potentially requiring more effort on your part.

'Notes' contain any information the creator feels you may want to know before using the deck,
such as factors contributing to other columns' statuses.


## Deck List

<!--
	All new decks *must* be added to this list.
	Please conform to the labels above, making your best guess for any values you're unsure of.
	The goal is to briefly inform users of anything they may want to know before using the deck.
	Keep notes concise. These are generally good for sorting and quality details.
	Don't forget to link to the game's Steam store page, or other marketplace if unavailable.
	Thank you!
