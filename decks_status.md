# Deck Statuses

A complete list of decks in this repository, with store page links, current status, and quality details.


## Columns

* __Game & Store Page__: game title and link to the most appropriate store page (e.g. Steam) when possible.

* __Progress__: how complete the deck is currently. `-` means 100% of feasible content is added.

* __Sortedness (1-10)__: how sorted the cards are in terms of gameplay order, roughly speaking.
Games are generally non-linear, so this value only accounts for that portion of gameplay this is predictable, if any.

* __Quality (1-10)__: how the creator feels about the deck's overall quality, independent of other columns.
Lower quality decks will generally contain more parsing errors, potentially requiring more effort on your part to use.

* __Notes__: any details the creator feels you may want to know before using the deck,
such as organization of muliple CSVs, or factors contributing to the rated quality or sortedness.


## Deck List

<!--
	All new decks *must* be added to this list.
	Please conform to the labels above, making your best guess for any values you're unsure of.
	The goal is to briefly inform users of anything they may want to know before using the deck.
	Keep notes concise. These are generally good for sorting and quality details.
	Don't forget to link to the game's Steam store page, or other marketplace if unavailable.
	Thank you!
