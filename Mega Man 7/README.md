# Mega Man 7

Annotated transcript sourced from [LLGTV](http://www.lltvg.com/wiki/Mega_Man_7/Transcript) (credit to Mew seeker!)


* "In-Game" is everything but the "Shop" dialogue and text. Though each stage individually only has smattering of dialogue, the order of bosses in the transcript is:
	* Cloud Man
	* Freeze Man
	* Junk Man
	* Burst Man
	* Turbo Man
	* Spring Man
	* Slash Man
	* Shade Man

* "Combined" is "Shop" followed by "In-Game". The former is short, and mostly appears at the beginning anyway I think, so going chronologically shouldn't be too bad.
