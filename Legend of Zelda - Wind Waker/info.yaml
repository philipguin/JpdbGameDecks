  (Website is inconsistently down as of August 2024.)

  The final text had plenty of script macros left in,
  but I tried to reduce them to minimal "understandable tokens" for the JPDB parser,
  so it could (hopefully) identify other words correctly.

  Input text is sorted mostly by function, starting with UI then tutorial, with minimal story-related order.
