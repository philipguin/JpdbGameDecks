<p>A complete list of decks in this repository, with store page links, current status, and quality details.</p>

<h2>Columns</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Game & Store Page</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Game title and link to the most appropriate store page (e.g. Steam) when possible.</li>
        <li>Also notes current progress if incomplete.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Difficulty (1-10)</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>How difficult the Japanese level of the game is (the same as jpdb's rating).</li>
        <li>May include factors outside the scope of the deck, such as grammar patterns.</li>
        <li>Subscript indicates the kind of large language model (LLM) used to derive the number, if any.</li>
        <li>(LLMs can be unreliable, but are suitable in this particular context.)</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Sortedness (1-10)</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>How sorted the cards are in terms of gameplay order, roughly speaking.</li>
        <li>Games are generally non-linear, so this value only accounts for that portion of gameplay this is predictable, if any.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Quality (1-10)</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Quality of the deck, independent of other columns.</li>

    </ul>
    <li><strong>Notes & Sources</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Any details the deck creator feels you may want to know before using the deck,</li>
        <li>such as organization of multiple CSVs, or factors contributing to the rated quality or sortedness.</li>
        <li>Also includes attribution to other peoples' work (e.g. translations) if used.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Contributor</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The name or username of the person who created the deck itself.</li>
